\title{TailoredBayes: A package for targeted Bayesian inference for binary outcomes}
\description{
The package provides functions for tailored Bayesian inference when different classification errors incur
different penalties. See vignette for an introduction.
}
\section{TailoredBayes functions}{

The main function is \code{metrop_tailor()} which uses random walk MCMC algorithm to sample from the posterior.
It returns a list object where the first element, \code{chain}, is of class "mcmc". This element can be summarized by
functions provided by the coda package or similar ones. See function doc for details.

The \code{ESS_t()} function calculates the effective sample size for tailoring, i.e., the sample size
inferences will be based on.
